The postcode-api-wrapper package offers a simple API to the Postcode.nl API REST service.
To use the API-service you will need an *access_key* and *access_secret*. For details check api.postcode.nl_.

You may consider using *virtualenv* to create isolated Python environments. Python 3.4 has *pyvenv* providing
the same kind of functionality.
